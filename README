Apache::CrowdCookieAuth - Apache authentication handler that uses
Atlassian Crowd and the Crowd cookie, rather than HTTP Basic Auth.

login.cgi - Perl CGI script to handle login, logout, and login with
redirection.

OVERVIEW

This perl module allows you to configure Apache to use Atlassian Crowd
to handle authentication using the crowd domain cookie.  This module
is based on a combination of Atlassian's CrowdAuth code and
SourceSense's modifications.  Rather than patch Atlassian's code
on-disk, Jim created a new self-contained module with a different
name.

Hopefully Atlassian will adopt the minor changes to their Perl library
code so this separate module can cease to exist.
